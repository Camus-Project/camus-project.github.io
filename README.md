## The AI ​​Challenge

Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the Art of Code. Beyond obvious benefits, new challenges are emerging. The most pressing is _trust_. The Camus project aims to address it by providing the required tools.

### The Problem of Trust

Ultimately, trust is a human problem, not a technical one. And no human problem has a purely technical solution, but technology helps to find a human solution.

Trust rests on a promise made by human beings. This promise binds them. This commitment is proven by signatures. Only then the technical aspect begins: it aims to guarantee the authenticity and persistence of these signatures. Because if the commitment is not honored, these signatures are used to demand redress, and this redress is refused if the signatures have not persisted until then or if their authenticity is not verified.

AI cannot sign. Or only by delegation from human beings, who assume responsibility for the signature and any potential redress. AI is not a subject of law. Whether it could one day become so is more than hypothetical and debatable, and falls outside the scope of the problems that the Camus project aims to solve.

Moreover, if AIs were to become responsible, they would have every interest in using our tools to supervise their irresponsible agents and prove their good faith.
